**Placement Prediction using Machine Learning**

This project is a Machine Learning based system that predicts whether a student will get placed based on academic and personal factors.
The goal of this project is to understand the complete ML workflow from data preprocessing to model training and prediction.

**Technologies Used**
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook

**Project Files**
placement.csv – original dataset
placement_prediction.ipynb – notebook (EDA + model training)
model.pkl – trained machine learning model

**How to Run**

1. Install required libraries
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

2. Open the notebook
jupyter notebook p1.ipynb

3. Run all cells to see analysis and predictions

**Learning Outcomes**
Understood data preprocessing and visualization
Learned how to train and save ML models
Gained hands-on experience with a real-world prediction problem
